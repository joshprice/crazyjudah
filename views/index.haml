      years of professional experience.
    %p
      Our repertoire traces the history of rock. The classic rock
      of Deep Purple, Bad Company, Pink Floyd and Santana, through the 80s
      big-hair rock of Bon Jovi and Van Halen. The stadium rock of INXS and
      U2 and the grunge sounds of the Stone Temple Pilots and the Foo
      Fighters, to bands like Coldplay and Muse.

    %h3 Who is Crazy Judah?
    %p
      Theodore Dehone Judah was a 19th century engineer who first proposed
      the radical notion of a transcontinental railway that would connect
      the east coast of the USA to the west. Thought by many to be a pioneer, he
      was nicknamed 'Crazy Judah' for his enthusiasm and single-mindedness.
